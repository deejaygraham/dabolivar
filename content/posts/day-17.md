Today, Iâ€™ll follow up on [yesterdayâ€™s topic](https://www.dabolivar.com/posts/day-16/). You can read up on it if you like, but the gist of it is that beginning anything with a positive assumption is probably better than the opposite. In the web itâ€™s called **Optimistic Updates**. And after today, I think we can extend the idea to the way we write tests as well. 

## Coffe & Triangles
In the morning, I met with  [Tobias](https://twitter.com/tpflug) and [Chris](https://twitter.com/c089) in a cozy coffee shop to discuss and write a bit of code. We paired on the problem that [Evren](https://twitter.com/yortuc) describes in this medium post:  [Counting Triangles â€“ Evren YortuÃ§boylu â€“ Medium](https://medium.com/@yortuc/counting-triangles-8c92ab998682). The idea is that, given a set of lines, our program should find out how many triangles are created by them. Itâ€™s very mathematical and I wonâ€™t go into any details here. What I want to talk about, is the approach we took today to solving the problem. And how it blew up in our faces ðŸ”¥.

Our first test went something like _given these 3 lines that do form a triangle, return the correct result of 1_. So far so good. And then I derailed us entirely by proposing that our next tests should be about the **negative** cases. Fast forward 1 hour and 15 minutes, and we had the following set of tests: 

{{< highlight javascript >}}
const A = {x: 0, y: 0};
const B = {x: 100, y: 0};
const C = {x: 50, y: 100};
const D = {x: 5555, y: 5555};

it('Finds a triangle where there is one', () => {
  const lines = [
    [A, B],
    [B, C],
    [C, A]
  ];
  const expected = 1;
  const actual = countTriangles(lines);
  assert.equal(actual, expected);
});

it('Does not find a triangle where there are no connections between first and last line', () => {
  const lines = [
    [A, B],
    [B, C],
    [C, D]
  ];
  const expected = 0;
  const actual = countTriangles(lines);
  assert.equal(actual, expected);
});

it('Does not find a triangle where there are no connections between second and last line', () => {
  const lines = [
    [A, B],
    [B, C],
    [A, D]
  ];
  const expected = 0;
  const actual = countTriangles(lines);
  assert.equal(actual, expected);
});

it('Does not find a triangle where there are no connections between first and second line', () => {
  const lines = [
    [A, B],
    [D, C],
    [C, A]
  ];
  const expected = 0;
  const actual = countTriangles(lines);
  assert.equal(actual, expected);
});
{{< /highlight >}}

And, a pair of ugly functions that did the bare minimum to make our tests pass and looked sort of like this: 

{{< highlight javascript >}}
const areNotConnected = (line1, line2) => {
  return line1[0] !== line2[1];
}

const countTriangles = lines => {
  if(
    areNotConnected(lines[0], lines[2]) ||
    areNotConnected(lines[2], lines[1]) ||
    areNotConnected(lines[1], lines[0])
  ) {
    return 0;
  }
  return 1;
};
{{< /highlight >}}

**Note:** We were writing Ruby, so just imagine for a second that Javascript can manage object equality.

At this point, we knew what our next step should have been: Add all possible comparisons that define wether a pair of lines are connected or not (without counting intersections, just endpoint connections). But, believe it or not, after trying for 30 minutes or so, we couldnâ€™t write a test that would drive us there. We reached an impasse in our process. 

We eventually reached the conclusion that my choice of negative case tests had driven us into a metaphorical wall. There was no simple, small step that we could take to keep on going. There were huge leaps that would clean up our mess, but thatâ€™s just not the way it should happen. 

I believe that positive case tests would have taken us on another road entirely, one that wouldâ€™ve never reached such an early bump. And seeing the garbled mess left behind, I think itâ€™s pretty safe to assure that **TDD** by itself **does not** guarantee anything even remotely close to good design. I didnâ€™t have time to test out my hypothesis about positive test cases, but Iâ€™m not yet done with this whole triangle business. Far from it.
