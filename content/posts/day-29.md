Today was a weird day. I had almost no direct contact with anyone and somehow ended up emotionally drained anyway. So, while I gather my thoughts, I decided to start a list of the folks I look up to in the web development world, and the reasons why I do. So, without further ado, hereâ€™s a group of awesome people who also happen to be amazing at what they do: 

* **[Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo)** âž¡ Sheâ€™s the author of [SVG Animations](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920045335.do), part of the core team of Vue JS and an amazing developer whoâ€™s always willing to share knowledge and teach others. Iâ€™ve learned a lot over the last year from just following her on [twitter](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo). Also, read the book if you're at all interested in the topic. It's marvelous. 
* **[Ana Tudor](https://twitter.com/anatudor)** âž¡ Her [Codepen creations](https://codepen.io/thebabydino) always leave me in awe and remind me how much CSS is capable off and how we donâ€™t need fancy frameworks for everything.  
* **[Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks)** âž¡ Everything inclusive design. Creator of [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/), a list of common UI elements that we usually get wrong. Go [here](http://www.heydonworks.com/) for more. 
* **[Brian Lonsdorf](https://twitter.com/drboolean)** âž¡ His [video series on Functional Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_tkIpwbsxY) patterns in JS blew my mind when I first saw it and got me interested in FP.  Also, this [free course on Egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) is just as amazing. 

I think itâ€™s very important to find and follow people who are great at what we do. It pops the comfortable bubble our brain builds around us to keep us safe. It helps us grow. 

Iâ€™ll keep sharing brilliant people of the internet once in a while. And I wouldnâ€™t mind recommendations of other awesome people to follow as well ðŸ¦„
