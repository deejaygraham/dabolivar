## Who?
Daniel Bolivar, aspiring **Software Crafter**. 

## What?
Currently doing a **Software Crafter Apprenticeship** at [Holidaycheck](https://www.holidaycheck.de/). 

## Why?
- Because I was given the opportunity to learn and develop myself personally and professionaly as a full time job for 6 months. I'd have to be crazy to say no to such an opportunity. 
- Because I'm not done learning and hope to never be. 
- Because I like a good challenge.
